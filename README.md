# Hops-Haven
Our team collaborated to plan the architecture and technologies for our full-stack web application following the PVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm. We chose to use React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB as our database. We decided to follow the MVC pattern to improve code organization, maintainability, and scalability.
