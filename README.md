# Hops-Haven

Hops-Haven is a full-stack web application that beer enthusiasts can use to find data on the beers they love and discover new beers they might enjoy. Our team collaborated to plan the architecture and technologies for the application, following the PVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm. We chose to use Handlebar for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Sequelize as our database, all of which allowed us to build a scalable and maintainable application that met our client's needs.

## Description

Our application provides users with an intuitive and user-friendly interface that makes it easy to browse and search for information about beers. Whether you're someone who's just getting into beer or a seasoned enthusiast, Hops-Haven is designed to be accessible to everyone.

We started building the application by creating the backend and developing an API that could handle all the requests sent from the frontend. We defined the routes, set up the database connection, and implemented user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure that only authorized users could access certain parts of the application.

Next, we built the frontend using Handlebar. We defined the components and views and integrated them with the backend API, making sure that the user interface was responsive, user-friendly, and accessible.

Finally, we connected the frontend with the backend, making API calls to fetch and display data in real-time. We also made sure that the data persisted in the database by creating the necessary models, controllers, and services.

Overall, we believe that beer enthusiasts will love using Hops-Haven to find data on the beer they like and discover new beers they might enjoy. Our application is designed to be easy to use, highly functional, and secure, with robust user authentication and encryption features that help to protect users' personal information and data.

## Installation

### Installation:

Have you ever wanted to search through a listing of Beers to find exactly what you're looking for? Our team decided on creating a web application that contained an expansive back catalog of beer types and descriptions utilizing a Web API and Sequelize databases. Using the Punk API, we were able to incorporate their database into our own application. Punk API is a free open public domain beer database & schema for use in any (programming) language (e.g. uses plain text data sets). To install this project, a knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web API’s, and Server Side API, Node.js, and Express.js, SQL, Sequelize, Handlebars, and Heroku were required. Methods used ranged from functions, document window methods, querySelector, getElementById, Event Listeners, Variables, If/Else Statements, and the Punk API link and key.

The web application is intended for the user to be able to enter our website, initially land on the Homepage which will give them options to sign in and create an account, or login if they are already a member. Once they do this they will enter the user personalized dashboard which includes a search bar for the user to enter the word “beer” to get all beers, or a beer name or type in order to pull from the Punk API’s database. The user can then select and remove from either their beer “Favorites List”, “Beers to Try”, and upon refresh are able to see a randomly suggested beer and type. We installed the following dependencies with my npm install (bcrypt, dotenv, express-handlebars, mysql2, and sequelize). Bcrypt was used for password hashing, and express-handlebars that uses a template and an input object to generate HTML. When the template is executed, these expressions are replaced with values from an input object.  The code below makes this happen.
