# Hops-Haven

Hops-Haven is a full-stack web application that beer enthusiasts can use to find data on the beers they love and discover new beers they might enjoy. Our team collaborated to plan the architecture and technologies for the application, following the PVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm. We chose to use Handlebar for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Sequelize as our database, all of which allowed us to build a scalable and maintainable application that met our client's needs.

## Description

Our application provides users with an intuitive and user-friendly interface that makes it easy to browse and search for information about beers. Whether you're someone who's just getting into beer or a seasoned enthusiast, Hops-Haven is designed to be accessible to everyone.

We started building the application by creating the backend and developing an API that could handle all the requests sent from the frontend. We defined the routes, set up the database connection, and implemented user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure that only authorized users could access certain parts of the application.

Next, we built the frontend using Handlebar. We defined the components and views and integrated them with the backend API, making sure that the user interface was responsive, user-friendly, and accessible.

Finally, we connected the frontend with the backend, making API calls to fetch and display data in real-time. We also made sure that the data persisted in the database by creating the necessary models, controllers, and services.

Overall, we believe that beer enthusiasts will love using Hops-Haven to find data on the beer they like and discover new beers they might enjoy. Our application is designed to be easy to use, highly functional, and secure, with robust user authentication and encryption features that help to protect users' personal information and data.
