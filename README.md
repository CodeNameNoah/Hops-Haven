# Hops-Haven

Our team collaborated to plan the architecture and technologies for our full-stack web application following the PVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm. We chose to use Handlebar for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Sequelize as our database. We decided to follow the MVC pattern to improve code organization, maintainability, and scalability.

## Description

After we had established our technology stack and architecture, we began building the application. We started by creating the backend and developing an API that could handle all the requests sent from the frontend. We defined the routes, set up the database connection, and implemented user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure that only authorized users could access certain parts of the application.

Next, we built the frontend using Handlebar. We defined the components and views and integrated them with the backend API. We made sure that the user interface was responsive, user-friendly, and accessible.

Finally, we connected the frontend with the backend, making API calls to fetch and display data in real-time. We also made sure that the data persisted in the database by creating the necessary models, controllers, and services.

Overall, building a full-stack web application following the PVC paradigm and implementing user authentication while creating our server-side API and connecting it to a database was a challenging but rewarding experience. Our teamwork, planning, and use of modern technologies helped us build a scalable and maintainable application that met our client's needs.
